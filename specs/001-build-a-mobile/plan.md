## Summary
Grupito is a mobile application for Brazilian users to organize groups and events. The app enables group creation, event management, RSVP systems, and member management with a Portuguese Brazilian interface. Technical implementation uses Expo (React Native), Clerk authentication, and Supabase database with best practices for component architecture and the existing Brazilian-themed color palette.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript with React Native (Expo SDK 50+)
**Primary Dependencies**: @clerk/clerk-expo, expo-secure-store, Supabase Client, React Navigation 6
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL database with real-time subscriptions
**Testing**: Jest with React Native Testing Library, Detox for E2E
**Target Platform**: iOS 13+ and Android API 21+ (React Native supported versions)
**Project Type**: mobile - determines mobile app + API structure
**Performance Goals**: <2s app launch, <500ms navigation, <1s data sync
**Constraints**: Offline-capable for viewing, Brazilian Portuguese UI, responsive design
**Scale/Scope**: 1000+ concurrent users, 10000+ groups, 50000+ events capacity

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitution Status**: Template only found - no specific constitutional constraints to evaluate
**Result**: PASS - No violations detected

**Structure Decision**: Option 3 - Mobile + API architecture based on Expo mobile app requirements

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks Completed
1. **Expo + Clerk + Supabase Integration**:
   - Decision: Use Expo managed workflow with Clerk for auth and Supabase for data
   - Rationale: Fastest development with production-ready authentication and real-time database
   - Alternatives considered: Firebase (rejected due to Supabase real-time features), AWS Amplify (complex setup)

2. **Mobile Navigation Architecture**:
   - Decision: React Navigation 6 with bottom tabs + stack navigation
   - Rationale: Standard React Native navigation with excellent tab-based group/event organization
   - Alternatives considered: Expo Router (too new), React Native Navigation (unnecessary complexity)

3. **State Management**:
   - Decision: React Query + Zustand for local state
   - Rationale: React Query handles server state/caching perfectly with Supabase, Zustand for simple local state
   - Alternatives considered: Redux Toolkit (overkill), Context only (performance issues)

4. **Real-time Features**:
   - Decision: Supabase Realtime for live RSVP updates and notifications
   - Rationale: Built-in real-time subscriptions for instant member response updates
   - Alternatives considered: WebSockets (manual implementation), Pusher (additional cost)

5. **Offline Capability**:
   - Decision: React Query persistence + AsyncStorage for critical data
   - Rationale: Cache group/event data for offline viewing, sync on reconnection
   - Alternatives considered: Redux Persist (complex), SQLite (unnecessary for read-only offline)

6. **Brazilian Color Palette**:
   - Decision: Extend existing grupito-old color system with Brazilian themes
   - Rationale: Maintain brand consistency while adding mobile-optimized Brazilian cultural elements
   - Colors: Primary teal (#20B2AA), Brazilian accents (blue: #002776, yellow: #FFDF00, green: #009739)

**Output**: ✅ research.md generated with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model Entities
1. **User**: Clerk user + profile extension
2. **Group**: Community container with members and settings
3. **Event**: Time-bound activities within groups
4. **Membership**: User-Group relationship with roles
5. **RSVP**: User response to event invitations

### API Contracts Generated
- **Groups API**: CRUD operations, member management, discovery
- **Events API**: CRUD, RSVP handling, notifications
- **Users API**: Profile management, preferences
- **Memberships API**: Join/leave groups, role management

### Test Scenarios Extracted
- Group creation and member invitation flow
- Event creation with automatic member notification
- RSVP workflow with real-time updates
- Member management and permission handling

### Agent Context Updated
- ✅ CLAUDE.md updated with Expo, Clerk, Supabase context
- Added Brazilian color palette and mobile-specific guidelines
- Included React Native best practices and testing approaches

**Output**: ✅ data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md generated

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each API contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Mobile-specific tasks: navigation setup, component library, authentication flow
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Database setup → API models → mobile auth → core screens → real-time features
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)
- Mobile: Auth setup → Navigation → Components → Screens → Integration

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks covering both API and mobile development

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations requiring justification*

N/A - All decisions follow standard mobile development patterns within constitutional bounds.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (N/A)
